This is an AI client that builds on libtpproto-java. Implementation and usage details to follow soon!


ARGUMENTS: (Mandatory) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supplying arguments will put GenCon in autorun mode, with no further input required.
However, typing 'q', then pressing 'ENTER' at any point in the game will terminate operation.
(SEMI-BUG: Note that currently it only works when 'q' is the first character in the buffer of the keyboard Scanner...
which means that whenever another character is entered before 'q', this will not work!)
	 
The argument syntax is as follows: (Case sensitive!)
----------------------------------
 1) The game to be played: 'RFTS' or 'RISK'.
 2) The server URI: The serverURI must include user info for autologin, 
		e.g. "tp://guest:guest@thousandparsec.net/tp".
 3) The class-path to the genome file, which will be used.
 4) The difficulty of the AI. Valid input is '1' to '9'.
 5) Verbose debug mode, or normal (quiet) mode. 'd' signifies debug, while 'n' means normal mode.

 Here's an example of what a run might look like:
 > java GenConRunner RISK tp://me:me@localhost /genomes/DarkSide_risk_genome 8 n 


*** If the argument syntax is incorrect, or else some argument is faulty for any reason, the client will terminate upon catching that.
