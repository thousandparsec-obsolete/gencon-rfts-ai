This is an AI client that builds on libtpproto-java. Implementation and usage details to follow soon!


Arguments: (Optional) 
	 * Optional arguments: '-a $ serverURI genomeFileClasspath' (All or none must be provided!)
	 * Supplying arguments will put GenCon in autorun mode, with no further input required. Verbose debug mode will be on.
	 * Otherwise, the client will run in 'normal' mode, i.e. start up from user input.
	 *
	 * The argument syntax is as follows:
	 * ----------------------------------
	 * 1) The first argument must be '-a', which stands for autorun.
	 * 2) The second argument is the difficulty. The '$' symbol stands for any number between 1-9, inclusive.
	 * 3) The third argument specifies the server URI:
	 *		The serverURI must include user info for autologin, e.g.: "tp://guest:guest@thousandparsec.net/tp".
	 * 4) The fourth argument specifies the classpath of the 'robo-genome' file.
	 *
	 * If the argument syntax is incorrect, or else some argument is faulty for any reason, the client will terminate upon catching that.
